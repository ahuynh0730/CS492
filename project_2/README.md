# Project 2 - Dart Adventure

## Introduction

Become more comfortable in Flutter development by learning the Dart programming language. Build a simple Dart console program to practice the development workflow, exercise the Dart toolchain, and to explore the features of the language.


### Learning Outcomes

1.	Identify the Dart documentation as the official source of information about the Dart language. (MLO 1)
2.	Describe the role of the programming language in the context of a mobile software development toolchain. (MLO 2)
3.	Define programming language features drawn from procedural, object-oriented and functional paradigms. (MLO 3)
4.	Apply the Dart programming language to meet the requirements of a simple functional specification. (MLO 4)
5.	Identify opportunities to apply refactoring to improve the quality of code (MLO 5).
